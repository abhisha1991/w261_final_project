# W261 Final Project - Flight Delay Prediction

## Introduction
Flight delays create problems in scheduling for airlines and airports, leading to passenger inconvenience, and huge economic losses. As a result there is growing interest in predicting flight delays beforehand in order to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction. In this project, you will be predicting flight delays using the datasets provided. 

## Problem

For now, the problem to be tackled in this project is framed as follows:
Predict departure delay/no delay, where a delay is defined as 15-minute delay (or greater) with respect to the planned time of departure. This prediction should be done two hours ahead of departure (thereby giving airlines and airports time to regroup and passengers a heads up on a delay).
